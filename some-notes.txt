import { ref } from "vue";

In Vue 3, ref is used to create reactive references to data. It allows you to track and react to changes in simple values like strings, numbers, or objects. When the value of a ref changes, Vue automatically updates the DOM or any other reactive parts of your application that depend on that value.
